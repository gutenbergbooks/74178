OUT FROM THE HEART
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
THE HEART AND THE LIFE
</h3>

<p>
As the heart, so is the life.  The within is
ceaselessly becoming the without.  Nothing
remains unrevealed.  That which is hidden is but
for a time; it ripens and comes forth at last.
Seed, tree, blossom, and fruit is the fourfold
order of the universe.  From the state of a
man's heart proceed the conditions of his life;
his thoughts blossom into deeds, and his deeds
bear the fruitage of character and destiny.
</p>

<p>
Life is ever unfolding from within, and revealing
itself to the light, and thoughts engendered
in the heart at last reveal themselves in
words, actions, and things accomplished.
</p>

<p>
As the fountain from the hidden spring, so
issues man's life from the secret recesses of his
heart.  All that he is and does is generated
there.  All that he will be and do will take its
rise there.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow and gladness, suffering and enjoyment,
hope and fear, hatred and love, ignorance
and enlightenment, are nowhere but in
the heart; they are solely mental conditions.
</p>

<p>
Man is the keeper of his heart; the watcher
of his mind; the solitary sentinel of his citadel
of life.  As such, he can be diligent or
negligent.  He can keep his heart more and more
carefully; he can more strenuously watch and
purify his mind; and he can guard himself
against the thinking of unrighteous thoughts:
this is the way of enlightenment and bliss.  On
the other hand, he can live loosely and
carelessly, neglecting the supreme task of rightly
ordering his life: this is the way of
self-delusion and suffering.
</p>

<p>
Let a man realize that life in its totality
proceeds from the mind, and lo, the way of
blessedness is opened up to him!  For he will then
discover that he possesses the power to rule his
mind, and to fashion it in accordance with his
Ideal.  So will he elect to strongly and
steadfastly walk those pathways of thought and
action which are altogether excellent; to him
life will become beautiful and sacred; and,
sooner or later, he will put to flight all evil,
confusion and suffering; for it is impossible
for a man to fall short of liberation, enlightenment,
and peace, who guards with unwearying
diligence the gateway of his heart.
</p>

<h3>
THE NATURE AND POWER OF MIND
</h3>

<p>
Mind is the arbiter of life; it is the creator
and shaper of conditions, and the recipient of
its own results.  It contains within itself both
the power to create illusion and to perceive
reality.
</p>

<p>
Mind is the infallible weaver of destiny;
thought is the thread, good and evil deeds are
the warp and woof, and the web, woven upon
the loom of life, is character.  Mind clothes
itself in garments of its own making.
</p>

<p>
Man, as a mental being, possesses all the
powers of mind, and is furnished with illimitable
choice.  He learns by experience, and he
can accelerate or retard his experience.  He is
not arbitrarily bound at any point, but he has
bound himself at many points, and having
bound himself he can, when he chooses, liberate
himself.  He can become bestial or pure,
ignoble or noble, foolish or wise, just as he chooses.
He can, by recurring practice, form habits, and
he can, by renewed effort, break them off.  He
can surround himself with illusions until Truth
is completely lost, and he can destroy one and
another of those illusions until Truth is
entirely recovered.  His possibilities are
limitless; his freedom is complete.
</p>

<p>
It is in the nature of mind to create its own
conditions, and to choose the states in which it
shall dwell.  It also has the power to alter any
condition and to abandon any state, and this it
is continually doing as it gathers knowledge of
state after state by repeated choice and
exhaustive experience.
</p>

<p>
Inward processes of thought make up the
sum of character and life, and man can modify
and alter these processes by bringing will and
effort to bear upon them.  The bonds of habit,
impotence, and sin are self-made, and can only
be destroyed by one's self; they exist nowhere
but in one's mind, and although they are
directly related to outward things, they have no
real existence in those things.  The outer is
moulded and vivified by the inner, and never
the inner by the outer.  Temptation does not
arise in the outer object, but <i>in the lust of the
mind for that object</i>; nor do suffering and
sorrow inhere in the external things and happenings
of life, but in an undisciplined attitude
of mind toward those things and happenings.
The mind that is disciplined by Purity and
fortified by Wisdom, avoids all those lusts and
desires which are inseparably bound up with
affliction, and so arrives at enlightenment and
peace.
</p>

<p>
To condemn others as evil, and to rail against
outside conditions as the source of evil,
increases, and does not lessen, the world's
suffering and unrest.  The outer is but the shadow
and effect of the inner, and when the heart is
pure all outward things are pure.
</p>

<p>
All growth and life is from within outward;
all decay and death is from without inward;
this is a universal law.  All evolution proceeds
from within.  All adjustment must take place
within.  He who ceases to strive against others,
and employs his powers in the transformation,
regeneration, and development of his own mind,
conserves his energies and preserves himself;
and as he succeeds in harmonizing his own
mind, he leads others by consideration and
charity into a like blessed state, for not by
assuming authority and guidance over other minds
is the way of enlightenment and peace discovered,
but by exercising a lawful authority over
one's own, and by guiding one's self in
pathways of steadfast and lofty virtue.
</p>

<p>
A man's life proceeds from his heart, his
mind: he has compounded that mind by his own
thoughts and deeds: it is in his power to
refashion that mind by his choice of thought: he
can therefore transform his life.  Let us see
how this is to be done.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
FORMATION OF HABIT
</h3>

<p>
Every established mental condition is an
<i>acquired habit</i>, and it has become such by
continuous repetition of thought.  Despondency
and cheerfulness, anger and calmness, covetousness
and generosity&mdash;indeed, all states of mind&mdash;are
habits built up by choice, until they have
become automatic.  A thought constantly
repeated at last becomes a fixed habit of the mind,
and from such habits proceeds the life.
</p>

<p>
It is in the nature of the mind to acquire
knowledge by the repetition of its experiences.
A thought which it is very difficult, at first, to
hold and to dwell upon, at last becomes, by
constantly being held in the mind, a natural and
habitual condition.  Just as a boy, when
commencing to learn a trade, cannot even handle
his tools aright, much less use them correctly,
but after long repetition and practice plies them
with perfect ease and consummate skill, so a
state of mind, at first apparently impossible of
realization, is, by perseverance and practice, at
last acquired and built into the character as a
natural and spontaneous condition.
</p>

<p>
In this power of the mind to form and reform
its habits, its conditions, is contained the
basis of man's salvation, and the open door to
perfect liberty by the mastery of self, for as a
man has the power to form harmful habits, so
he has the same power to create habits that are
essentially good.  And here we come to a point
which needs some elucidating, and which calls
for deep and earnest thought on the part of my
reader.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly said to be easier to do wrong
than right, to sin than to be holy; such condition
has come to be regarded, almost universally,
as axiomatic, and no less a teacher than the
Buddha has said:&mdash;"Bad deeds, and deeds hurtful
to ourselves, are easy to do; what is beneficial
and good, that is very difficult to do,"&mdash;and
as regards humanity generally, this is true,
but it is only true as a passing experience, a
fleeting factor in human evolution; it is not a
fixed condition of things, is not of the nature
of an eternal truth.  It is easier for men to do
wrong than right, because of the prevalence of
ignorance, because the true nature of things,
and the essence and meaning of life, are not
apprehended.  When a child is learning to
write, it is extremely easy for it to hold the pen
wrongly, and to form its letters incorrectly, but
it is painfully difficult to hold the pen and to
write properly; and this because of the child's
ignorance of the art of writing, which can only
be dispelled by persistent effort and practice,
until, at last, it becomes natural and easy to
hold the pen properly, and to write correctly,
and difficult, as well as altogether unnecessary,
to do the wrong thing.  It is the same in the
vital things of mind and life.  To think and do
rightly requires much practice and renewed
effort, but the time at last comes when it
becomes habitual and easy to think and do rightly,
and difficult, as it is then seen to be altogether
unnecessary, to do that which is wrong.
</p>

<p>
Just as an artisan becomes, by practice,
accomplished in his craft, so a man can become,
by practice, accomplished in goodness; it is
entirely a matter of forming new habits of
thought, and he to whom right thoughts have
become easy and natural, and wrong thoughts
and acts difficult to do, has attained to the
highest virtue, to pure, spiritual knowledge.
</p>

<p>
It is easy and natural for men to sin, because
they have formed, by incessant repetition,
harmful and unenlightened habits of thought.  It is
very difficult for the thief to refrain from
stealing when opportunity occurs, because he has
lived so long in covetous and avaricious
thoughts; but such difficulty does not exist for
the honest man who has lived so long in
upright and honest thoughts, and has thereby
become enlightened as to the wrong, folly, and
fruitlessness of theft, that even the remotest
idea of stealing does not enter his mind.  The
sin of theft is a very extreme one, and I have
introduced it in order to the more clearly
illustrate the force and formation of habit; but all
sins and virtues are formed in the same way.
Anger and impatience are natural and easy to
thousands of people, because they are constantly
repeating the angry and impatient thought and
act, and with each repetition the habit is more
firmly established and more deeply rooted.
Calmness and patience can become habitual in
the same way&mdash;by first grasping through effort,
a calm and patient thought, and then continuously
thinking it, and living in it, until "use
becomes second nature," and anger and impatience
pass away for ever.  It is thus that every
wrong thought may be expelled from the mind;
thus that every untrue act may be destroyed;
thus that every sin may be overcome.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
DOING AND KNOWING
</h3>

<p>
Let a man realize that his life, in its totality,
proceeds from his mind, and that that mind is
a combination of habits which he can, by patient
effort, modify to any extent, and over which he
can thus gain complete ascendancy and control,
and he has at once obtained possession of the
key which shall open the door to his complete
emancipation.
</p>

<p>
But emancipation from the ills of life (which
are the ills of one's mind) is a matter of steady
growth from within, and not a sudden acquisition
from without.  Hourly and daily must the
mind be trained to think stainless thoughts, and
to adopt right and dispassionate attitudes
under those circumstances in which it is prone to
fall into wrong and passion.  Like the patient
sculptor upon his marble, the aspirant to the
Right Life must gradually work upon the crude
material of his mind until he has wrought out
of it the Ideal of his holiest dreams.
</p>

<p>
In working toward such supreme accomplishment,
it is necessary to commence at the lowest
and easiest steps, and proceed by natural and
progressive stages to the higher and more
difficult.  This law of growth, progress, evolution,
unfoldment, by gradual and ever ascending
stages, is absolute in every department of life,
and in every human accomplishment, and where
it is ignored, total failure will result.  In
acquiring learning, in learning a trade, or in
pursuing a business, this law is fully recognized
and minutely obeyed by all; but in acquiring
Virtue, in learning Truth, and in pursuing the
right conduct and knowledge of life, it is
unrecognized and disobeyed by nearly all; hence
Virtue, Truth, and the Perfect Life remain
unpractised, unacquired, and unknown.
</p>

<p>
It is a common error to suppose that the
Higher Life is a matter of reading, and the
adoption of theological or metaphysical hypotheses,
and that Spiritual Principles can be
apprehended by this method.  The Higher Life is a
higher living in thought, word, and deed, and
the knowledge of those Spiritual Principles,
which are imminent in man and in the universe
can only be acquired after long discipline in the
pursuit and practice of Virtue.
</p>

<p>
The lesser must be thoroughly grasped and
understood before the greater can be known, and
practice always precedes real knowledge.  The
schoolmaster never attempts to teach his pupils
the abstract principles of mathematics at the
commencement; he knows that by such a method
teaching would be vain, and learning impossible.
He first places before them a simple sum, and,
having explained it, leaves them to do it.  When,
after repeated failures and ever-renewed effort,
they have succeeded in doing it correctly, a more
difficult task is set them, and then another and
another; and not until the pupils have, through
many years of diligent application, mastered
all the lessons in arithmetic, does he attempt to
unfold to them the underlying mathematical
principles.
</p>

<p>
In learning a trade, say that of a mechanic,
the boy is not at first taught the principles of
mechanics, but a simple tool is put into his hand
and he is told how rightly to use it, and is then
left to do it by effort and practice.  As he
succeeds in plying his tools correctly, more and
more difficult tasks are set him, until, after
several years of successful practice, he is prepared
to study and grasp the principles of mechanics.
</p>

<p>
In a properly governed household, the child
is first taught to be obedient, and to conduct
itself properly under all circumstances.  The
child is not even told why it must do this, but
is commanded to do it, and only after it has so
far succeeded in doing what is right and proper,
is it told why it should do it.  No father would
attempt to teach his child the principles of ethics
before exacting from it the practice of filial
duty and social virtue.
</p>

<p>
Thus practice ever precedes knowledge even
in the ordinary things of the world, and in
spiritual things, in the living of the Higher
Life, this law is rigid in its exactions.  Virtue
can only be known by doing, and the knowledge
of Truth can only be arrived at by perfecting
oneself in the practice of Virtue and to be
complete in the practice and acquisition of Virtue is
to be complete in the knowledge of Truth.
</p>

<p>
Truth can only be arrived at by daily and
hourly doing the lessons of Virtue, beginning
at the simplest, and passing on to the more
difficult; and as a child patiently and obediently
learns its lessons at school, constantly practising,
ever exerting itself until all failures and
difficulties are surmounted, even so does the
child of Truth apply himself to right-doing in
thought and action, undaunted by failure, and
made stronger by difficulties; and as he
succeeds in acquiring Virtue, his mind unfolds
itself in the knowledge of Truth, and it is a
knowledge in which he can securely rest.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
FIRST STEPS IN THE HIGHER LIFE
</h3>

<p>
Seeing that the Path of Virtue is the Path of
Knowledge, and that before the all-embracing
Principles of Truth can be comprehended,
perfection in the more lowly steps must be
acquired, how, then, shall a disciple of Truth
commence?  How shall one who aspires to the
righting of his mind and the purification of his
heart&mdash;that heart which is the fountain and
repository of all the issues of life&mdash;learn the
lessons of Virtue, and thus build himself up in
the strength of knowledge, destroying ignorance
and the ills of life?  What are the first
lessons, the first steps?  How are they learned?
How are they practised?  How are they
mastered and understood?
</p>

<p>
The first lessons consist in overcoming those
wrong mental conditions which are the most
easily eradicated, and which are the common
barriers to spiritual progress, as well as in
practising the simple domestic and social virtues;
and the reader will be the better aided if I group
and classify the first ten steps in three lessons
as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<pre>
  VICES TO BE OVERCOME AND ERADICATED.

  VICES OF THE BODY.

  1. Indolence.                             ) FIRST LESSON.
  2. Self-indulgence.                       ) Discipline of the Body.

  VICES OF THE TONGUE.

  1. Slander.                               )
  2. Gossip and idle conversation.          ) SECOND LESSON.
  3. Abusive and unkind speech.             )   Discipline of 
                                            )      Speech.
  4. Levity, or irreverent speech.          ) 
  5. Captiousness, or fault-finding speech. )

  VIRTUES TO BE PRACTICED AND ACQUIRED.

  1. Unselfish performance of duty.         ) THIRD LESSON.
                                            )   Discipline of
  2. Unswerving rectitude.                  )   Inclination.
  3. Unlimited forgiveness.                 )
</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The two vices of the body, and five of the
tongue, are so called because they are
manifested in the body and tongue, and also
because, by so definitely classifying them, the
mind of the reader will be the better helped;
but it must be clearly understood that these
vices arise primarily in the mind, and are
wrong conditions of heart worked out in the
body and the tongue.
</p>

<p>
The existence of such chaotic conditions is an
indication that the mind is altogether unenlightened
as to the real meaning and purpose of life,
and their eradication is the beginning of a
virtuous, steadfast, and enlightened life.
</p>

<p>
But how shall they be overcome and eradicated?
By first, and at once, checking and
controlling their outward manifestations, by
suppressing the wrong act; this will stimulate the
mind to watchfulness and reflection until, by
repeated practice, it will at last come to perceive
and understand the dark and wrong conditions
of mind, out of which such acts spring, and will
abandon them entirely.
</p>

<p>
It will be seen that the first step in the
discipline of the mind is the overcoming of
indolence.  This is the easiest step, and until it is
perfectly accomplished, the other steps cannot
be taken.  The clinging to indolence constitutes
a complete barrier to the Path of Truth.
Indolence consists in giving the body more ease and
sleep than it requires, in procrastinating, and
in shirking and neglecting those things which
should receive immediate attention.  This
condition of laziness must be overcome by rousing
up the body at any early hour, giving it just the
amount of sleep it requires for complete
recuperation, and by doing promptly and vigorously,
every task and duty, no matter how small,
as it comes along.  On no account should food
or drink be taken in bed, and to lie in bed after
one has wakened, indulging in ease and reverie,
is a habit fatal to promptness and resolution of
character, and purity of mind.  Nor should one
attempt to do his thinking at such a time.
Strong, pure, and true thinking is impossible
under such circumstances.  A man should go to
bed to sleep, not to think.  He should get up to
think and work, not to sleep.
</p>

<p>
The next step is the overcoming of
self-indulgence, or gluttony.  The glutton is he who
eats for animal gratification only, without
considering the true end and object in eating, who
eats more than his body requires, and is greedy
after sweet things and rich dishes.  Such
undisciplined desire can only be overcome by
reducing the quantity of food eaten, and the
number of meals per day, and by resorting to a
simple and uninvolved dietary.  Regular hours
should be set apart for meals, and eating at
other times should be rigidly avoided.  Suppers
should be abolished, as they are altogether
unnecessary, and conduce to heavy sleep and
cloudiness of mind.  The pursuit of such a
method of discipline will rapidly bring the
hitherto ungoverned appetite under control, and as
the sensual sin of self-indulgence is taken out
of the mind, the right selection of food will be
instinctively and infallibly adapted to the
purified mental condition.
</p>

<p>
It should be well borne in mind that change
of heart is the needful thing, and that any
change of diet which does not subserve this end
is futile.  Whilst one eats for enjoyment he is
gluttonous.  The heart must be purified of
sensual craving and gustatory lust.
</p>

<p>
When the body is well controlled and firmly
guided; when that which is to be done is done
vigorously; when no task or duty is delayed;
when early rising has become a delight; when
frugality, temperance, and abstinence are firmly
established; when one is contented with the food
which is put before him, no matter how scant and
plain, and the craving for gustatory pleasure
is at an end,&mdash;then are the first two steps in
the Higher Life accomplished; then is the first
great lesson in Truth learned.  Thus is established
in the heart the foundation of a poised,
self-governed, virtuous life.
</p>

<p>
The next lesson is the lesson of Virtuous
Speech, in which are five orderly steps.  The
first step is the overcoming of slander.
Slander consists in inventing or repeating evil
reports about others, in exposing and magnifying
the faults of others, or of absent friends, and in
introducing unworthy insinuations.  The
elements of thoughtlessness, cruelty, insincerity,
and untruthfulness enter into every slanderous
act.  He who aims at the living of the right life
will commence to check the cruel word of slander
before it has gone forth from his lips, and
will then check and eliminate the insincere
thought which gave rise to it.  He will watch
himself that he does not vilify any, and will
refrain from disparaging and condemning the
absent friend, whose face he has so recently kissed,
or shaken his hand, or smiled into his face.  He
will not say of another that which he dare not
say to him.  Thus, coming at last to think
sacredly of the character and reputation of others,
he will destroy those wrong conditions of mind
which give rise to slander.
</p>

<p>
The next step is the overcoming of gossip and
idle conversation.  Idle speech consists in talking
about the private affairs of others, in talking
merely to pass away the time, and in engaging
in aimless and irrelevant conversation.  Such
an ungoverned condition of speech is the outcome
of an ill-regulated mind.  The man of
virtue will bridle his tongue, and thus learn how
rightly to govern the mind.  He will not let his
tongue run idly and foolishly, but will make his
speech strong and pure and will either talk with
a purpose or remain silent.
</p>

<p>
Abusive and unkind speech is the next vice to
be overcome.  The man who abuses and accuses
others has himself wandered far from the Right
Way.  To hurl hard words and names at others
is to sink deeply into folly.  When a man is
inclined to abuse and condemn others, let him
restrain his tongue and look in upon himself.
The virtuous man refrains from abuse and
quarrelling, and employs only words that are useful,
necessary, pure, and true.
</p>

<p>
The next step is the overcoming of levity, or
irreverent speech.  Light and frivolous talking;
the repeating of coarse jokes; the telling of
vulgar stories, having no other purpose than to
raise an empty laugh; offensive familiarity, and
the employment of contemptuous and irreverent
terms when speaking to or of others, and
particularly of one's elders and those who rank as
one's teachers, guardians, or superiors,&mdash;all this
will be put away by the lover of Virtue and
Truth.
</p>

<p>
Upon the altar of irreverence absent friends
and companions are immolated for the passing
excitement of a momentary laugh, and all the
sanctity of life is sacrificed to the zest for
ridicule.  When respect towards others and the
giving of reverence where reverence is due are
abandoned, Virtue is abandoned.  When modesty,
gravity, and dignity are eliminated from
speech and behavior, Truth is lost, yea, even
its entrance gate is hidden away and forgotten.
Irreverence is degrading even in the young, but
when it accompanies grey hairs, and appears in
the demeanor of the preacher,&mdash;this is indeed a
piteous spectacle; and when this can be imitated
and followed after, then are the blind leading
the blind, then have elders and preacher and
people lost their way.
</p>

<p>
The virtuous man will be of grave and reverent
speech; he will think and speak of the
absent as he thinks and speaks of the
dead&mdash;tenderly and sacredly; he will put away
thoughtlessness, and watch that he does not
sacrifice his dignity to gratify a passing
impulse to lightness and frivolity.  His mirth will
be pure and innocent, and his voice will
become subdued and musical, and his soul be filled
with grace and sweetness as he succeeds in
conducting himself as becomes a man of Truth.
</p>

<p>
The last step in the second lesson is the
overcoming of captiousness, or fault-finding speech.
This vice of the tongue consists in magnifying
and harping on small or apparent faults, in
foolish quibbling and hair-splitting, and in
pursuing vain arguments based upon groundless
suppositions, beliefs, and opinions.  Life is
short and real, and sin and sorrow and pain are
not remedied by carping and contention.  The
man who is ever on the watch to catch at the
words of others in order to contradict and
controvert them, has yet to reach the higher way
of holiness, the truer life of self-surrender.  The
man who is ever on the watch to check his own
words in order to soften and purify them will
find the higher way and the truer life; he will
conserve his energies, maintain his composure
of mind, and preserve within himself the spirit
of Truth.
</p>

<p>
When the tongue is well controlled and wisely
subdued; when selfish impulses and unworthy
thoughts no longer rush to the tongue demanding
utterance; when the speech has become
harmless, pure, gentle, gracious, and purposeful,
and no word is uttered but in sincerity and
truth,&mdash;then are the five steps in virtuous
speech accomplished, then is the second great
lesson in Truth learned and mastered.
</p>

<p>
And now some will ask, "But why all this
discipline of the body and restraint of the
tongue?  Surely the Higher Life can be
realized and known without such strenuous labor,
such incessant effort and watchfulness?"  No,
it cannot.  In the spiritual as the material,
nothing is done without labor, and the higher
cannot be known until the lower is fulfilled.
Can a man make a table before he has learned
how to handle a tool and drive a nail?  And can
a man fashion his mind in accordance with
Truth before he has overcome the slavery of his
body?  As the intricate subtleties of language
cannot be apprehended and wielded before the
alphabet and the simplest words are mastered,
neither can the deep subtleties of the mind be
understood and purified before the ABC of
right conduct is perfectly acquired.  As for the
labor involved&mdash;does not the youth joyfully and
patiently submit himself to a seven-years'
apprenticeship in order to master a craft?  And
does he not day by day carefully and faithfully
carry out every detail of his master's instructions,
looking forward to the time when, perfected
through obedience and practice, he shall
be himself a master?  Where is the man who
sincerely aims at excellence in music, painting,
literature, in any trade, business, or profession
who is not willing to give his whole life to the
acquirement of his particular perfection?  Shall
labor, then, be considered where the very highest
excellence is concerned&mdash;the excellence of
Truth?  He who says, "The Path which you
point out is too difficult; I must have Truth
without labor, salvation without effort," that
man will not find his way out of the confusions
and sufferings of self-hood; he will not find the
calm and well-fortified mind and the wisely
ordered life.  His love is for ease and enjoyment,
and not for Truth.  He who, deep in his heart,
adores Truth, and aspires to know it, will
consider no labor too great to be undertaken, but
will adopt it joyfully and pursue it patiently,
and by perseverance in practice he will come
to the knowledge of Truth.
</p>

<p>
The necessity for this preliminary discipline
of the body and tongue will be the more clearly
perceived when it is fully understood that all
these wrong outward conditions are merely the
expressions of wrong conditions of heart.  An
indolent body means an indolent mind; an
ill-regulated tongue reveals an ill-regulated mind,
and the process of remedying the manifested
condition is really a method of rectifying the
inward state.  Moreover, the overcoming of
these conditions is only a small part of what is
really involved in the process.  The ceasing
from evil leads to, and is inseparably connected
with, the practice of good.  While a man is
overcoming indolence and self-indulgence, he is
really cultivating and developing the virtues of
abstinence, temperance, punctuality, and
self-denial, and is acquiring that strength, energy,
and resolution which are indispensable to the
successful accomplishment of the higher tasks.
While he is overcoming the vices of speech, he
is developing the virtues of truthfulness,
sincerity, reverence, kindliness, and self-control,
and is gaining that mental steadiness and
fixedness of purpose, without which the remoter
subtleties of the mind cannot be regulated, and
the higher stages of conduct and enlightenment
cannot be reached.  Also, as he has to do right,
his knowledge deepens, and his insight is
intensified, and as the child's heart is glad when
his school task is mastered, so with each victory
achieved, the man of virtue experiences a bliss
which the seeker after pleasure and excitement
can never know.
</p>

<p>
And now we come to the third lesson in the
Higher Life, which consists in practising and
mastering, in one's daily life, three great
fundamental Virtues&mdash;(1) Unselfish Performance of
Duty; (2) Unswerving Rectitude; and (3)
Unlimited Forgiveness.  Having prepared the
mind by overcoming the more surface and
chaotic conditions mentioned in the two first
lessons, the striver after Virtue and Truth is now
ready to enter upon greater and more difficult
tasks, and to control and purify the deeper
motives of the heart.  Without the right
performance of duty, the higher virtues cannot be
known, and Truth cannot be apprehended.
Duty is generally regarded as an irksome
labor, a compulsory something which must
be toiled through, or be in some way
circumvented.  This way of regarding Duty
proceeds from a selfish condition of mind, and a
wrong understanding of life.  All duty should
be regarded as sacred, and its faithful and
unselfish performance one of the leading rules of
conduct.  All personal and selfish
considerations should be extracted and cast away from the
doing of one's duty, and when this is done,
Duty ceases to be irksome, and becomes joyful.
Duty is only irksome to him who craves some
selfish enjoyment or benefit for himself.  Let
the man who is chafing under the irksomeness
of his duty look to himself, and he will find
that his wearisomeness proceeds, not from the
duty itself, but from his selfish desire to escape
it.  He who neglects duty, be it great or small,
or of a public or private nature, neglects Virtue;
he who in his heart rebels against Duty, rebels
against Virtue.  When Duty has become a thing
of love, and when every particular duty is done
accurately, faithfully, and dispassionately, there
is much subtle selfishness removed from the
heart, and a great step is taken towards the
heights of Truth.  The virtuous man concentrates
his mind on the perfect doing of his own
duty, and does not interfere with the duty of
another.
</p>

<p>
The second step in the third lesson is the
practice of Unswerving Rectitude.  This
Virtue must be firmly established in the mind, and
so enter into every detail of man's life.  All
dishonesty, deception, trickery, and misrepresentation
must be for ever put away, and the heart be
purged of every vestige of insincerity and
subterfuge.  The least swerving from the path of
rectitude is a deviation from Virtue.  There
must be no extravagance and exaggeration of
speech, but the simple truth should be stated.
Engaging in deception, no matter how apparently
insignificant, for vain-glory, or with the
hope of personal advantage, is a state of
delusion which one should make efforts to dispel.
It is demanded of the man of Virtue that he
shall not only practice the most rigid honesty in
thought, word, and deed, but that he shall be
exact in his statements, omitting and adding
nothing to the actual truth.  In thus shaping
his mind to the principle of Rectitude, he will
gradually come to deal with people and things
in a just and impartial spirit, considering
equity before himself, and viewing all things
with freedom from personal bias, passion, and
prejudice.  When the Virtue of Rectitude is
fully practised, acquired, and comprehended,
so that all temptation to untruthfulness and
insincerity has ceased, then is the heart made
purer and nobler, then is character strengthened,
and knowledge enlarged, and life takes on a
new meaning and a new power.  Thus is the
second step accomplished.
</p>

<p>
The third step is the practice of Unlimited
Forgiveness.  This consists in overcoming the
sense of injury which springs from vanity,
selfishness, and pride; and in exercising
disinterested charity and large-heartedness towards
all.  Spite, retaliation, and revenge are so utterly
ignoble, and so small and foolish, as to be
altogether unworthy of being noticed or harbored.
No one who fosters such conditions in his heart
can lift himself above folly and suffering, and
guide his life aright.  Only by casting them
away, and ceasing to be moved by them, can a
man's eyes be opened to the true way in life;
only by developing a forgiving and charitable
spirit can he hope to approach and perceive the
strength and beauty of a well-ordered life.  In
the heart of the strongly virtuous man no
feeling of personal injury can arise; he has put
away all retaliation, and has no enemies; and
if men should constitute themselves his
enemies, he will regard them kindly, understanding
their ignorance, and making full allowance
for it.  When this state of heart is arrived at,
then is the third step in the discipline of one's
self-seeking inclinations accomplished; then is
the third great lesson in Virtue and Knowledge
learned and mastered.
</p>

<p>
Having thus laid down the first ten steps and
three lessons in right-doing and right-knowing,
I leave those of my readers who are prepared for
them to learn and master them in their everyday
life.  There is, of course, a still higher
discipline of the body, a more far-reaching
discipline of the tongue, and greater and more
all-embracing virtues to acquire and understand
before the highest state of bliss and knowledge
can be apprehended, but it is not my purpose to
deal with them here.  I have expounded only
the first and easiest lessons on the Higher Path,
and by the time these are thoroughly mastered,
the reader will have become so purified,
strengthened, and enlightened, that he will not
be left in the dark as to his future progress.
Those of my readers who have completed these
three lessons will already have perceived,
beyond and above, the high altitudes of Truth,
and the narrow and precipitous track which
leads to them, and will choose whether they shall
proceed.
</p>

<p>
The straight Path which I have laid down
can be pursued by all with greater profit to
themselves and to the world, and even those who
do not aspire to the attainment of Truth, will
develop greater intellectual and moral strength,
finer judgment, and deeper peace of mind by
perfecting themselves in this Path.  Nor will
their material prosperity suffer by this change
of heart; nay, it will be rendered truer, purer,
and more enduring, for if there is one who is
capable of succeeding and fitted to achieve, it is
the man who has abandoned the petty
dissipations and everyday vices of his kind, who is
strong to rule his body and his mind, and who
pursues with fixed resolve the path of
unswerving integrity and sterling virtue.

<h3>
MENTAL CONDITIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS
</h3>

<p>
Without going into the details of the greater
steps and lessons in the right life (a task outside
the scope of this small work) a few hints and
statements concerning those mental conditions
from which life in its totality springs, will
prove helpful to those who are ready and willing
to penetrate further into that inner realm of
heart and mind where Love and Wisdom and
Peace await the strenuous comer.
</p>

<p>
All sin is ignorance.  It is a condition of
darkness and undevelopment.  The wrong-thinker
and wrong-doer is in the same position
in the school of life as is the ignorant pupil in
the school of learning.  He has yet to learn
how to think and act correctly, that is, in
accordance with Law.  The pupil in learning is
not happy so long as he does his lessons wrongly,
and unhappiness cannot be escaped while sin
remains unconquered.
</p>

<p>
Life is a series of lessons.  Some are diligent
in learning them, and they become pure, wise,
and altogether happy.  Others are negligent,
and do not apply themselves, and they remain
impure, foolish, and unhappy.
</p>

<p>
Every form of unhappiness springs from a
wrong condition of mind.  Happiness inheres
in right conditions of mind.  Happiness is
mental harmony; unhappiness is mental inharmony.
While a man lives in wrong conditions
of mind, he will live a wrong life, and will
suffer continually.  Suffering is rooted in error.
Bliss inheres in enlightenment.  There is
salvation for man only in the destruction of his
own ignorance, error, and self-delusion.  Where
there are wrong conditions of mind there is
bondage and unrest; where there are right
conditions of mind there is freedom and peace.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the leading wrong mental
conditions and their disastrous effects upon the
life:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<pre>
  WRONG MENTAL            THEIR EFFECTS.
    CONDITIONS.

  Hatred.                 Injury, violence, disaster, and
                            suffering.

  Lust.                   Confusion of intellect, remorse,
                            shame, and wretchedness.

  Covetousness.           Fear, unrest, unhappiness, and loss.

  Pride.                  Disappointment, chagrin, lack of
                            self-knowledge.

  Vanity.                 Distress, and mortification of spirit.

  Condemnation.           Persecution, hatred from others.

  Ill-will.               Failures and troubles.

  Self-indulgence.        Misery, loss of judgment, grossness,
                            disease, and neglect.

  Anger.                  Loss of power and influence.

  Desire, or              Grief, folly, sorrow, uncertainty, and
    Self-slavery.           loneliness.
</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The above wrong conditions of mind are
merely negations; they are states of darkness
and deprivation and not of positive power.
Evil is not a power; it is ignorance and misuse
of good.  The hater is he who has failed to do
the lesson of Love correctly, and he suffers in
consequence.  When he succeeds in doing it
rightly, the hatred will have disappeared, and
he will see and understand the darkness and
impotence of hatred.  It is so with every wrong
condition.
</p>

<p>
The following are some of the more important
right mental conditions and their beneficent
effects upon the life:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br></p>

<pre>
  RIGHT MENTAL          THEIR EFFECTS.
    CONDITIONS.

  Love.                 Gentle conditions, bliss, and blessedness

  Purity.               Intellectual clearness, joy, invincible
                          confidence.

  Selflessness.         Courage, satisfaction, happiness, and
                          plenty.

  Humility.             Calmness, restfulness, knowledge of
                          Truth.

  Meekness.             Equipoise, contentment under all
                          circumstances.

  Compassion.           Protection, love and reverence from
                          others.

  Goodwill.             Gladness and success.

  Self-control.         Peace of mind, true judgment,
                          refinement, health, and honor.

  Patience.             Mental power, far-reaching influence.

  Self-conquest.        Enlightenment, wisdom, insight, and
                          profound peace.
</pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The above right conditions of mind are states
of positive power, of light, of joyful possession,
and of knowledge.  The good man knows.  He
has learned to do his lessons correctly, and
thereby understands the exact proportions which
make up the sum of life.  He is enlightened,
and knows good and evil.  He is supremely
happy, doing only that which is divinely right.
</p>

<p>
The man who is involved in the wrong conditions
of mind, does not know.  He is ignorant
of good and evil, of himself, of the inward
causes which make his life.  He is unhappy,
and believes other people are entirely the cause
of his unhappiness.  He works blindly, and
lives in darkness, seeing no central purpose in
existence, and no orderly and lawful sequence
in the course of things.
</p>

<p>
He who aspires to the attainment of the
Higher Life in its completion&mdash;who would
perceive with unveiled vision the true order of
things and the meaning of life&mdash;let him abandon
all the wrong conditions of heart, and persevere
unceasingly in the practice of the good.
If he suffers, or doubts, or is unhappy, let him
search within until he finds the cause, and
having found it, let him cast it away.  Let him so
guard and purify his heart that every day less
of evil and more of good shall issue therefrom;
so will he daily become stronger, nobler, wiser;
so will his blessedness increase, and the Light of
Truth, growing ever brighter and brighter within
him, will dispel all gloom, and illuminate
his Pathway.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
EXHORTATION
</h3>

<p>
Disciples of Truth, lovers of Virtue,
seekers of Wisdom; ye, also, who are sorrow
stricken, knowing the emptiness of the self-life,
and who aspire to the life that is supremely
beautiful, and serenely glad,&mdash;take now
yourselves in hand, enter the Door of Discipline,
and know the Better Life.
</p>

<p>
Put away self-delusion; behold yourself as
you are, and see the Path of Virtue as it is.
There is no lazy way to Truth.  He who would
stand upon the mountain's summit must
strenuously climb, and must rest only to gather
strength.  But if the climbing is less glorious
than the cloudless summit, it is still glorious.
Discipline in itself is beautiful, and the end of
discipline is sweet.
</p>

<p>
Rise early and meditate.  Begin each day
with a conquered body, and a mind fortified
against error and weakness.  Temptation will
never be overcome by unprepared fighting.  The
mind must be armed and arrayed in the silent
hour.  It must be trained to perceive, to know,
to understand.  Sin and temptation disappear
when right understanding is developed.
</p>

<p>
Right understanding is reached through unabated
discipline.  Truth cannot be reached but
through discipline.  Patience will increase by
effort and practice, and patience will make
discipline beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Discipline is irksome to the impatient man
and the self-lover, so he avoids it, and continues
to live loosely and confusedly.
</p>

<p>
Discipline is not irksome to the Truth-lover,
and he will find the infinite patience which can
wait and work and overcome.  As the joy of
the gardener who sees his flowers develop day
by day, so is the joy of the man of discipline
who sees the divine flowers of Purity, Wisdom,
Compassion, and Love, grow up in his heart.
</p>

<p>
The loose-liver cannot escape sorrow and
pain.  The undisciplined mind falls, weak and
helpless, before the fierce onslaught of passion.
</p>

<p>
Array well your mind, then, lover of Truth.
Be watchful, thoughtful, resolute.  Your
salvation is at hand; your readiness and effort are
all that are needed.  If you should fail ten
times, do not be disheartened; if you should
fail a hundred times, rise up and pursue your
way; if you should fail a thousand times, do
not despair.  When the right Path is entered,
success is sure if the Path is not utterly abandoned.
</p>

<p>
First strife, and then victory.  First labor,
and then rest.  First weakness, and then
strength.  In the beginning the lower life, and
the glare and confusion of battle, and at the
end the Life Beautiful, the Silence, and the
Peace.
